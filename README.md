EthnoPath: Traditional Knowledge Digitization Platform
Working Demo: Multi-Modal Cultural Knowledge Preservation
🏛️ Cloak & Quill Research - 501(c)(3) Public Charity
🎯 Mission: Preserve traditional knowledge through respectful digitization while maintaining cultural integrity

🚀 Live Working Demo: Real Traditional Knowledge Digitization
NOT just educational placeholders - this is a functional digitization platform!
🌿 Demonstrated Capabilities:

Multi-Modal Capture: Audio recordings, visual documentation, textual analysis
Cultural Context Preservation: Traditional preparation methods and cultural significance
Respectful Processing: Ethical boundaries with publicly-documented knowledge only
Real Results: Actual digitization of traditional plant knowledge

📊 Working Demo Results:
✅ 3 Traditional Plants Digitized: Aloe vera, Chamomile, Lavender
✅ Multi-Modal Integration: Audio + Visual + Text processing
✅ Cultural Context Preserved: Traditional preparation methods documented
✅ Ethical Boundaries Maintained: Only publicly-available knowledge used
✅ Processing Pipeline: Complete digitization workflow demonstrated

🔧 Technical Capabilities (Working Now!)
Real Multi-Modal Processing:

- **Audio Analysis:** Traditional knowledge spoken recordings processed and indexed
- **Visual Recognition:** Plant identification and preparation method documentation
- **Text Processing:** Cultural context extraction and preservation
- **Knowledge Graphs:** Relationship mapping between plants, uses, and cultural contexts

Cultural Preservation Framework:

- **Respectful Digitization:** Ethical guidelines built into every processing step
- **Context Preservation:** Traditional preparation methods and cultural significance maintained
- **Community Consent:** Framework for working with traditional knowledge holders (when applicable)
- **Attribution Protection:** Privacy-preserving attribution for knowledge sources


🧪 Live Demo: Try It Yourself
Working Demo Components:
```bash
# Clone and run the working demo
git clone https://github.com/Omnipath2025/ethnopath-demo.git
cd ethnopath-demo

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run traditional knowledge digitization demo
python demo/traditional_knowledge_demo.py
```
Expected output: Complete digitization of 3 traditional plants with cultural context

Aloe Vera: Traditional wound healing applications with preparation methods
Chamomile: Traditional calming uses with brewing techniques
Lavender: Traditional relaxation applications with extraction methods
